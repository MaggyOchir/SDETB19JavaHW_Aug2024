# Exercise 21: Calculating Sum of Two Numbers

## Objective
Learn how to use the `Scanner` class in Java to capture user input and perform arithmetic operations.

## Instructions

**Calculating Sum of Two Numbers**

In this project, you will write a small program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints their sum.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Capture First Number**
    - Print "Please Enter the First Number".
    - Capture the first number using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `number1`.

3. **Capture Second Number**
    - Print "Please Enter the Second Number".
    - Capture the second number using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `number2`.

4. **Calculate the Sum**
    - Calculate the sum of `number1` and `number2` and store the result in a variable called `sum`.

5. **Print the Sum**
    - Print the sum in the format: `The sum is: sum`.

## Expected Output
```
Please Enter the First Number
Please Enter the Second Number
The sum is: 15
```

## Tips
- Remember to import the `Scanner` class using `import java.util.Scanner;`.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use the `nextInt` method of the `Scanner` class to capture the input.

## Additional Information
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input is captured and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `Scanner` class in Java. Happy coding!
