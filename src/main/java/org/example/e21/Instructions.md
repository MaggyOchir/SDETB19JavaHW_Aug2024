# Exercise 22: Age Calculation

## Objective
Learn how to use the `Scanner` class in Java to capture user input and perform arithmetic operations.

## Instructions

**Age Calculation**

In this project, you will write a small program that asks the user for their age, adds 10 to it, and then displays the result.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Capture User's Age**
    - Print "Enter your age".
    - Capture the user's age using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `age`.

3. **Calculate Future Age**
    - Add 10 to the user's age and store the result in a variable called `futureAge`.

4. **Print the Future Age**
    - Print the future age in the format: `Your age after 10 years is futureAge`.

## Expected Output
```
Enter your age
30
Your age after 10 years is 40
```

## Tips
- Remember to import the `Scanner` class using `import java.util.Scanner;`.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use the `nextInt` method of the `Scanner` class to capture the input.

## Additional Information
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input is captured and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `Scanner` class in Java. Happy coding!
