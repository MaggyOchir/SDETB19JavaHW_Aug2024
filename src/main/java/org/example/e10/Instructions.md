# Exercise 10: Arithmetic Operations

## Objective
Learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Java.

## Instructions

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Variables**
    - Declare an integer variable `num1` and assign a value of 200 to it:
      ```java
      int num1 = 200;
      ```

    - Declare an integer variable `num2` and assign a value of 100 to it:
      ```java
      int num2 = 100;
      ```

2. **Perform Operations**
    - Add the two numbers and store the result in a variable `sum`:
      ```java
      int sum = num1 + num2;
      ```

    - Subtract the second number from the first and store the result in a variable `difference`:
      ```java
      int difference = num1 - num2;
      ```

    - Multiply the two numbers and store the result in a variable `product`:
      ```java
      int product = num1 * num2;
      ```

    - Divide the first number by the second and store the result in a variable `quotient`:
      ```java
      int quotient = num1 / num2;
      ```

3. **Print Values**
    - Print the values of each operation result on a separate line:
      ```java
      System.out.println(sum);
      System.out.println(difference);
      System.out.println(product);
      System.out.println(quotient);
      ```

4. **Run Your Program** to see the output.

## Expected Output
```
300
100
20000
2
```

## Tips
- Remember to use `System.out.println` to print each result on a new line.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **Integer Variables**: An integer variable can hold whole numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Use the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Java. Happy coding!
