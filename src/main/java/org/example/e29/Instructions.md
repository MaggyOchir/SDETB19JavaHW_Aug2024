# Exercise 29: Multiplication Sign Checker

## Objective
Learn how to use the `Scanner` class in Java to capture numerical input from the user and use simple `if-else` conditions to check if the product of two numbers is positive or negative.

## Instructions

**Multiplication Sign Checker**

In this project, you will write a small program that asks the user for two numbers, multiplies them, and prints `true` if the product is positive or `false` if the product is negative.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Capture Two Numbers**
    - Print "Please enter the first number" and capture the user's input using the `Scanner` object, storing it in a variable called `x`.
    - Print "Please enter the second number" and capture the user's input using the `Scanner` object, storing it in a variable called `y`.

3. **Check the Product**
    - Use an `if-else` statement to check if the product of `x` and `y` is positive or negative.
    - If the product is positive, print `true`.
    - If the product is negative, print `false`.

## Expected Output
```
Example Output:
Please enter the first number
3
Please enter the second number
4
true

Example Output:
Please enter the first number
-2
Please enter the second number
5
false
```

## Tips
- Remember to import the `Scanner` class using `import java.util.Scanner;`.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use the `nextDouble` method of the `Scanner` class to capture the numerical input.

## Additional Information
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.
- **Conditional Statements**: Use `if-else` statements to make decisions based on conditions.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input is captured and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `Scanner` class and `if-else` conditions in Java. Happy coding!
