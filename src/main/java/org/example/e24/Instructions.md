# Exercise 25: Greeting Message

## Objective
Learn how to use the `Scanner` class in Java to capture string input from the user and manipulate the string.

## Instructions

**Greeting Message**

In this project, you will write a small program that asks the user for their name and favorite color, then creates a fun greeting message.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Capture User's Name**
    - Print "What is your name?".
    - Capture the user's input using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `name`.

3. **Capture User's Favorite Color**
    - Print "What is your favorite color?".
    - Capture the user's input using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `color`.

4. **Create and Print a Greeting Message**
    - Create a greeting message using the captured inputs in the format: `"Hello name! It's great to know that your favorite color is color!"`.
    - Print the greeting message.

## Expected Output
```
What is your name?
Alice
What is your favorite color?
Blue
Hello Alice! It's great to know that your favorite color is Blue!
```

## Tips
- Remember to import the `Scanner` class using `import java.util.Scanner;`.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use the `nextLine` method of the `Scanner` class to capture the input.

## Additional Information
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input is captured and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `Scanner` class in Java. Happy coding!
