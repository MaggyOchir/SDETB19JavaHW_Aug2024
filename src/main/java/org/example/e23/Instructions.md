# Exercise 23: Task Completion Checker

## Objective
Learn how to use the `Scanner` class in Java to capture boolean input from the user in a practical scenario.

## Instructions

**Task Completion Checker**

In this project, you will write a small program that asks the user if they have completed certain tasks and displays the completion status.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Capture Task Completion Status**
    - Print "Have you completed your homework? (true/false)".
    - Capture the user's input using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `homeworkCompleted`.
    - Print "Have you completed your chores? (true/false)".
    - Capture the user's input using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `choresCompleted`.

3. **Print Task Completion Status**
    - Print the completion status for each task in the format: `Homework completed: homeworkCompleted`, `Chores completed: choresCompleted`.

## Expected Output
```
Have you completed your homework? (true/false)
true
Have you completed your chores? (true/false)
false
Homework completed: true
Chores completed: false
```

## Tips
- Remember to import the `Scanner` class using `import java.util.Scanner;`.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use the `nextBoolean` method of the `Scanner` class to capture the boolean input.

## Additional Information
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input is captured and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `Scanner` class in Java. Happy coding!
