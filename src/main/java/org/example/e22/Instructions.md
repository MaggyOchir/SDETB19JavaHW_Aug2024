# Exercise 22: User Information Capture

## Objective
Learn how to use the `Scanner` class in Java to capture multiple pieces of user input.

## Instructions

**User Information Capture**

In this project, you will write a small program that asks the user for their name, mobile number, and age, and then displays the information.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

2. **Capture User's Name**
    - Print "Enter your name".
    - Capture the user's name using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `name`.

3. **Capture User's Mobile Number**
    - Print "Enter your mobile number".
    - Capture the user's mobile number using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `mobileNumber`.

4. **Capture User's Age**
    - Print "Enter your age".
    - Capture the user's age using the `Scanner` object and store it in a variable called `age`.

5. **Print User Information**
    - Print the user's information in the format: `Your name is name, your age is age, and your mobile number is mobileNumber`.

## Expected Output
```
Enter your name
Enter your mobile number
Enter your age
Your name is Weqas, your age is 45, and your mobile number is 123-456-7890
```

## Tips
- Remember to import the `Scanner` class using `import java.util.Scanner;`.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Use the appropriate `Scanner` methods (`nextLine` for strings and `nextInt` for integers) to capture the input.

## Additional Information
- **Scanner Class**: The `Scanner` class is used to get user input. It is found in the `java.util` package.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input is captured and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `Scanner` class in Java. Happy coding!
